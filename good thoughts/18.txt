Do not let your fire go out spark by 
irreplaceable spark in the hopeless 
swamps of the not- quite, the not-yet, 
and the not-at-all. Do not let the 
hero in your soul perish in lonely 
frustration for the life you deserved and 
have never been able to reach. 
the world you desire can be won. it 
is real.. it os possible.. it's yours
